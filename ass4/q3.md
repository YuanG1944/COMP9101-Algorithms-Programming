### Yuan Gao z5239220 Q3
#### You are on vacation for $N$ days at a resort that has three possible activities. For each day, for each activity, youâ€™ve determined how much enjoyment you will get out of that activity. However, you are not allowed to do the same activity two days in a row. What is the maximum total enjoyment possible? 

##### 1. Formulated
> We can assume and create an activity `array[n][3]`:
> `n` present days and every day has 3 possible activities.
> For example:
>```
activities[4][3] = {
        {1, 2, 4},
        {1, 3, 2},
        {2, 5, 1},
        {3, 1, 2} 
    };
>```
> There are 4 days vacation.
> The element present how much enjoyment when people choice this activity.
##### 2. Dynamic programming array

> As the picture shows, in $i^{th}$:
> When we pick $a_i$, `activities[i][0] += max(activities[i - 1][1], activities[i - 1][2]);`
> When we pick $b_i$, `activities[i][1] += max(activities[i - 1][0], activities[i - 1][2]);`
> When we pick $c_i$, `activities[i][2] += max(activities[i - 1][1], activities[i - 1][0]);`
>The result is : $max(a_n, b_n, c_n)$

##### 3. Code
```cpp
int letsHappy(vector<vector<int>> activities){
    if(activities.size() == 0) return 0;
    if(activities.size() == 1) return max(activities[0][0], max(activities[0][1], activities[0][2]));

    int n = activities.size();
    for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i){
        activities[i][0] += max(activities[i - 1][1], activities[i - 1][2]);
        activities[i][1] += max(activities[i - 1][0], activities[i - 1][2]);
        activities[i][2] += max(activities[i - 1][1], activities[i - 1][0]);
    }
    
    return max(activities[n - 1][0], max(activities[n - 1][1], activities[2][0]));
}
```

##### 4. Time complexity
>Assume the  vacation is $n$ days
>>Traverse a activities array

>Hence, total time complexity is $O(n)$
