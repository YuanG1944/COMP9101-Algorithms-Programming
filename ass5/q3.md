#### There are $N$ computers in a network, labelled$\{1, 2, 3, . . . , N \}$. There are $M$ one-directional links which connect pairs of computers. Computer 1 is trying to send a virus to computer $N$. This can happen as long as there is a path of links from computer 1 to computer $N$. To prevent this, you’ve decided to remove some of the links from the network so that the two computers are no longer connected. For each link, you’ve calculated the cost of removing it. What is the minimum total cost to disconnect the computers as required, and which edges should be removed to achieve this minimum cost?

All the edges crossing such a minimal cut. The number of such edges (in the forward direction only) determines the minimum cost needed to disconnect the computer 1 to N.
