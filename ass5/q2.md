### Yuan Gao z5239220 Q2    
#### You are given a usual $n Ã— n$ chess board with k white bishops on the board at the given cells $(a_i,b_i)$, $(1 \le a_i,b_i \le n, 1 \le i \le k)$. You have to determine the largest number of black rooks you can place on the board so that no two rooks are in the same row or in the same column and are not under the attack of any of the $k$ bishops (recall that bishops go diagonally).

>**Step 1: Determine the coordinates:**   
>> According to the question:
>> If the white bishop in the chess board, the two diagonally cannot place rooks

>>y' = i - j, Dy\{(y' + 1, 1), (y' + 2, 2), (y' + 3, 3)... ...(n, n - y')\}  
>>$$
>>If $i < j:$
>>$$
>>y' = j - i, Dy\{(1, 1 + y'), (2, 2 + y'), (3, 3 + y')... ...(n - y', n)\}  
>>$$
>>If the coordinates in set $Dx$ and $Dy$, this place cannot put rook.

>**Step 3: Calculate the largest number of black rooks:**
>> Use Ford-Fulkerson method count maximal flow $M$  
>> The $M$ is the largest number of black rooks
